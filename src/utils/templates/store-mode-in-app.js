    <p>No more queuing at the fitting room, we'll let you know when it's free!</p>
    <p>From Store Mode, you will be able to book your slot in the fitting room directly using the APP. You will just have to select the fitting room area for which you would like to make your reservation. The APP will allocate a slot and inform you of the estimated waiting time. When a fitting room becomes available, you will receive a new notice and you will have five minutes to go to the fitting room.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind that this experience is only available at stores that offer this service and you can only book a fitting room if you are inside the store.</p>
