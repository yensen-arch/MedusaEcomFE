<p>We offer you the possibility to add a <strong>gift box</strong> to your order. We will show you this option and the corresponding amount during the purchase process, after adding the items to your basket.</p>
<p>
    We will prepare your order in a special box which will be sent in the usual packaging for our orders.
    </p>
<p>
Keep in mind that the boxes <strong>are not eligible for exchanges or returns.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This option is only available for online purchases. If you wish to prepare items purchased in a physical store as gifts, our staff will help you to package them in gift envelopes.
