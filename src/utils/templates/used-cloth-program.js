  <p>As part of our social and environmental commitment, we want to help you extend the useful life of your garments. To this end, we have developed a used clothing collection program.</p>
  <p>In collaboration with local non-profit organisations, we recover garments that are no longer used and give them a second life.</p>
  <p class="text-xs"><strong>How can you deliver your used clothing?</strong></p>
  <p>
    We have clothes collection containers in <strong>our stores</strong> where you can deposit the package with the clothes you wish to give away. You can check the stores that offer this service in our Store Finder. Remember to bring the clothing in a properly sealed package.

    <p>The aim of this initiative is to provide direct social support or to finance social projects that are developed and run by the non-profit organisations we work with.</p>
