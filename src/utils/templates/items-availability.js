    <h2 class="text-lg">ONLINE AVAILABILITY OF AN ITEM</h2>
    <p>We suggest you check our website to keep up to date with the latest news and availability of our products.</p>
    <p>If the size of the item you are interested in is out of stock, but has the Coming soon option, you can provide us with your email address and we will let you know if it is available again in the next 15 days. If it is not restocked within this period, the subscription will expire and you will have to re-register it. This process does not reserve the item.</p>
    <p>On some items, we may display a low stock message for certain sizes. If any of them are of interest to you, we encourage you to buy them so that you don't miss out.</p>
    <p>Bear in mind that the items in the basket are not reserved. If your basket includes items that are no longer available, we will notify you so that you can remove them and complete the purchase of the other items.</p>
    <div>
        On each item's page, you will find our suggestions to <strong>complete your look</strong> or <strong>similar products</strong> that may interest you.
